## About

This repository stores solutions, code samples, and documentation for various projects completed during the 42 cursus. Topics typically cover fundamental programming concepts, algorithms, software engineering practices, and system-level programming in C and other languages.

## Projects

The repository may include (examples below—edit as needed):

- **Libft**: Implementation of standard C library functions.
- **ft_printf**: Custom implementation of the printf function.
- **GNL (Get Next Line)**: Reading a file line by line efficiently.
- **pipex**: Simulation of shell-like pipelines between processes.
- **push_swap**: Efficiently sorting data using a limited set of stack operations.
- **so_long**: A simple 2D game demonstrating graphical programming basics.
- **philosophers**: Implementation of the classic dining philosophers problem using threads and synchronization primitives.

Check specific folders or files for details on each project.
